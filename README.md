# Amazon UI Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon website created for practice. It demonstrates the process of analyzing, replicating, and enhancing a website using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze how the Amazon UI is structured and how it functions. By replicating the interface and adding new features, I gain hands-on experience with frontend technologies and website design principles.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the page, making it visually appealing and responsive.

## Steps I Followed
1. **Website Analysis**: 
   - I studied the Amazon homepage to understand its structure, layout, and design.
   - I broke down the page into sections such as header, navigation bar, main content, and footer.
2. **HTML Structure**: 
   - I recreated the basic structure of the page with HTML, focusing on the header and navigation.
3. **Styling with CSS**: 
   - I styled the page using CSS, following the original design.

## Features Added
- **Search Bar**: A functional search bar that allows users to search for products.
- **Product Display**: A carousel/slider to showcase products.
- **Interactive Cart**: A mock cart system that allows users to add items to their cart.
